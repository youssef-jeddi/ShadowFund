        <Section title="1. Acceptance of Terms">
          <p>
            By accessing or using the Nox Confidential Token application (the
            &quot;App&quot;), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If
            you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must not use the
            App.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="2. Testnet Disclaimer">
          <p>
            The App operates exclusively on the <strong>Arbitrum Sepolia
            testnet</strong>. All tokens displayed, minted, wrapped, or
            transferred within the App have <strong>no real monetary
            value</strong>. This is a demonstration and testing environment
            only. Do not send real assets to any address generated or displayed
            by the App.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="3. Confidential Tokens">
          <p>
            The App showcases confidential tokens (cTokens) built on the
            ERC-7984 standard. While the protocol is designed to provide
            on-chain confidentiality through encrypted balances and selective
            disclosure, <strong>no guarantee of absolute privacy or
            confidentiality</strong> is made. The technology is experimental and
            under active development.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="4. Wallet Responsibility">
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for the security and management of your
            wallet, private keys, and seed phrases. The App does not store,
            access, or recover your private keys. Loss of access to your wallet
            is permanent and irreversible.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="5. No Financial Advice">
          <p>

            advice. The App is provided for educational and demonstration
            purposes only. You should consult appropriate professionals before
            making any financial decisions.
